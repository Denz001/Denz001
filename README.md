## Hi there 👋 Autumn here!

### 🌱I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS 😄

The goal is to get into Data Science, create an RPG game, and join a game jam. Since I have so many interests, I can't say when.

You know what they say, shoot for the :moon: so even if I miss, I can land among the :star::star:

I use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a> for my coding journey and CS50, and blog <a href="https://codejourn.wordpress.com">my experiences of learning them in wordpress.</a>
